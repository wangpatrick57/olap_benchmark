It also includes a disclaimer, stating that the font software is provided \"as is\" without any warranty and that the copyright holder is not liable for any damages or liabilities arising from the use of the font software.\n\nIn the larger context of the parkbench project, this license file ensures that the font \"Nanum\" can be used, modified, and distributed in compliance with the terms and conditions set by the SIL Open Font License. This allows the project to use the font in a legal and ethical manner.",
