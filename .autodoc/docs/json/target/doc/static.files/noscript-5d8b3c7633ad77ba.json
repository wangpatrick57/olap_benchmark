  "summary": "The code provided appears to be a CSS stylesheet. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. In the context of the parkbench project, this CSS code is likely used to style the user interface of the web application.\n\nThe code defines a set of CSS variables using the `:root` selector. These variables are used to define various colors and styles that can be easily modified and applied throughout the application. For example, `--main-background-color` and `--main-color` define the background color and text color for the main content area, respectively.\n\nThe code also includes media queries to handle different color schemes based on the user's preference. The `@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark)` query sets different values for the CSS variables when the user prefers a dark color scheme.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for defining the visual appearance of the parkbench web application. By using CSS variables, the code allows for easy customization and maintenance of the application's styling. Developers can modify the values of the variables to change the colors and styles used throughout the application.\n\nHere is an example of how the CSS variables defined in this code can be used in an HTML document:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"parkbench.css\">\n    <style>\n        body {\n            background-color: var(--main-background-color);\n            color: var(--main-color);\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Welcome to parkbench</h1>\n    <p>This is some example text.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `--main-background-color` and `--main-color` variables are used to set the background color and text color of the `body` element. By linking the `parkbench.css` stylesheet, the values defined in the CSS code will be applied to the HTML document.",
  "questions": "**Question 1:** What is the purpose of the code?\n- The purpose of this code is to define a set of CSS variables that control the styling of various elements in the parkbench project.\n\n**Question 2:** What are the different color schemes used in the code?\n- The code defines two color schemes: one for light mode and one for dark mode. The light mode color scheme uses mostly white and black colors, while the dark mode color scheme uses darker shades of gray.\n\n**Question 3:** How are the CSS variables used in the project?\n- The CSS variables defined in this code are likely used throughout the project's CSS files to apply consistent styling across different elements. They can be referenced using the `var()` function in CSS."
