The code provided is a JavaScript file that is part of the larger parkbench project. The purpose of this code is to handle the theme settings and switching functionality for the parkbench project.

The code begins by defining an array called `builtinThemes` which contains the names of the built-in themes available in the project. These themes are "light", "dark", and "ayu". It also defines an array called `darkThemes` which contains the names of the themes that are considered dark themes.

The code then assigns the `themeStyle` element from the HTML document to the `currentTheme` variable. This element is used to dynamically switch the theme by changing its `href` attribute.

Next, the code defines a function called `getSettingValue` which takes a `settingName` parameter and retrieves the current value of that setting. It first checks if there is a current value for the setting using the `getCurrentValue` function. If there is no current value and the `settingsDataset` is not null, it retrieves the default value for the setting from the `settingsDataset` object. The `settingsDataset` object is obtained from the `default-settings` element in the HTML document.

The code then retrieves the value of the "theme" setting using the `getSettingValue` function and assigns it to the `localStoredTheme` variable.

The code also defines three utility functions: `hasClass`, `addClass`, and `removeClass`. These functions are used to manipulate CSS classes on HTML elements.

The code then defines two functions: `onEach` and `onEachLazy`. These functions iterate over arrays and execute a callback function for each element in the array. The `onEach` function takes an array, a callback function, and an optional `reversed` parameter. It iterates over the array and calls the callback function for each element. If the callback function returns true, the iteration stops and the function returns true. The `onEachLazy` function is similar to `onEach`, but it converts a lazy array (such as a NodeList) to a regular array before iterating over it.

The code also defines two functions: `updateLocalStorage` and `getCurrentValue`. These functions are used to store and retrieve values from the browser's local storage.

The code defines a function called `getVar` which takes a `name` parameter and retrieves the value of a meta tag attribute with the name "rustdoc-vars" from the HTML document. It then returns the value of the attribute with the specified `name`.

The code defines a function called `switchTheme` which takes a `newThemeName` parameter and a `saveTheme` parameter. It first checks if the `saveTheme` parameter is true, and if so, it updates the value of the "theme" setting in the local storage. It then sets the "data-theme" attribute of the `documentElement` to the `newThemeName`. If the `newThemeName` is one of the built-in themes, it removes the `currentTheme` element from the document. Otherwise, it creates a new `link` element with the `newThemeName` as the `href` and appends it to the `documentElement`.

The code defines a function called `updateTheme` which is used to update the theme based on the current settings. It first checks if the "use-system-theme" setting is not set to "false". If it is not set or set to "true", it retrieves the values of the "preferred-light-theme" and "preferred-dark-theme" settings. It then updates the local storage with the value "true" for the "use-system-theme" setting and calls the `switchTheme` function with the appropriate light or dark theme based on the system's preferred color scheme. If the "use-system-theme" setting is set to "false", it calls the `switchTheme` function with the value of the "theme" setting.

The code also adds an event listener to the `matchMedia` object to listen for changes in the preferred color scheme. When the color scheme changes, it calls the `updateTheme` function.

The code checks if the "use-system-theme" setting is not set to "false" and if the `matchMedia` object is available. If both conditions are met and the "use-system-theme" setting and "preferred-dark-theme" setting are not set, it updates the local storage with the value of the `localStoredTheme` as the "preferred-dark-theme" setting.

The code then calls the `updateTheme` function to initially set the theme based on the current settings.

Finally, the code adds a class to the `documentElement` if the "source-sidebar-show" setting is set to "true". It also adds an event listener to the `window` object to listen for the "pageshow" event. When the event is triggered, it calls the `updateTheme` function after a short delay.

In summary, this code handles the theme settings and switching functionality for the parkbench project. It retrieves and stores theme settings in the local storage, updates the theme based on the current settings, and provides utility functions for manipulating CSS classes on HTML elements.
## Questions: 
 **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `settingsDataset` variable and how is it used in the code?

**Answer:** The `settingsDataset` variable is used to store the dataset of the `default-settings` element. It is used to retrieve default values for settings if the current value is null.

**Question 2:** How does the `switchTheme` function work and what does it do?

**Answer:** The `switchTheme` function is responsible for changing the theme of the website. It updates the localStorage with the new theme, sets the `data-theme` attribute of the `documentElement` to the new theme, and dynamically loads the CSS file for the new theme.

**Question 3:** What triggers the `updateTheme` function and what does it do?

**Answer:** The `updateTheme` function is triggered by a change in the media query `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and is also called when the page is loaded or when the `pageshow` event is triggered. It checks the current settings and updates the theme accordingly, either using the system theme or the preferred light/dark theme.
