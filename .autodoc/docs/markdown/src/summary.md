The `main.rs` file is a simple Rust program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. It serves as a basic template for a Rust project, demonstrating the structure of a Rust program. The `println!` macro is used to print formatted text to the console. This code can be used as a starting point for a Rust project, and can be built upon to create more complex applications. For example, the `main` function can be used to orchestrate the execution of other functions, initialize the project, and clean up resources before the program exits.

The `worker_pg_init.sh` file is a script that initializes a Postgres database on a worker node in the parkbench project. It takes two parameters: `pgdata_dpath` and `pgbin_dpath`, which are the directories for the Postgres data and binaries respectively. The script checks if the necessary directories and binaries are in place before running the `initdb` command. This code can be used to automate the initialization of a Postgres database on a worker node, streamlining the setup process for Postgres databases.

The `worker_pg_start.sh` file is a script that starts a Postgres instance on a worker node. It takes the same parameters as `worker_pg_init.sh`, and checks if all necessary preconditions are met before starting the instance. If the preconditions are met, the `pg_ctl` command is used to start the Postgres instance. This code provides a convenient way to start a Postgres instance on a worker node, ensuring that all necessary preconditions are met before starting the instance.

Example usage:

```bash
./worker_pg_start.sh /path/to/pgdata /path/to/pgbin
```

This command will start the Postgres instance using the specified data directory and bin directory. If the preconditions are not met, the script will display an error message and exit.
